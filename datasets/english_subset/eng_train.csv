As Figure 6.2 shows, contraceptive use levels rose rapidly in the 1980s, and, by the time of the 1992 EDHS, the overall use rate was 47 percent, almost twice the rate reported in the 1980 Egypt Fertility Survey (24 percent).

The use rate continued to rise—although at a more moderate rate—reaching 60 percent at the time of the 2003 EIDHS. Since 2003, the use rate has not changed significantly, fluctuating between 59 and 60 percent.

Figure 6.3 shows sharp declines in exposure to family planning information over the past decade in Egypt. For example, the proportion of women reporting exposure to family planning messages on television dropped from almost 90 percent in 2005 to less than 40 percent in 2014.

Figure 7.1 shows, the percentage of babies whose mothers are amenorrheic declines from over 95 percent in the two months immediately after a birth to 52 percent during the period two to three months after birth. By 4 to 5 months after a birth, mothers of only 36 percent of births are still amenorrheic, and by 12 to 13 months after a birth, mothers have not resumed menstruation in the case of only 16 percent of births. The median duration of postpartum amenorrhea is 3.4 months.	Percentage of births whose mothers are amenorrheic, abstaining, or insusceptible to the risk of pregnancy | 
As in other Islamic countries, many couples in Egypt observe the traditional practice of abstaining from sexual relations for a period of 40 days after a birth. Reflecting this tradition, the percentage of births for which the mother is still abstaining decreases rapidly, from 77 percent immediately (0-1 months) after a birth to 16 percent at 2 to 3 months after a birth.	Percentage of births whose mothers are amenorrheic, abstaining, or insusceptible to the risk of pregnancy | 
The combined effects of postpartum amenorrhea and postpartum abstinence are reflected in the period of postpartum insusceptibility after a birth. Overall, 60 percent of women are susceptible to the risk of pregnancy at 4-5 months after a birth, and around 75 percent are susceptible at 8 to 9 months after a birth.

The broad base depicts the youthfulness of the population.	Population pyramid | Percent | 
The drop in the female population between ages 10- 14 and 15-19 is a bit steep and could partially be due to some interviewers estimating ages of women to be under the interview cutoff age of 15 to reduce their workload.	Population pyramid | Percent | 
Similarly, there is an increase in the female population between ages 45-49 and 50-54, which might be due to pushing some of the women out of the age eligibility category.	Population pyramid | Percent |
